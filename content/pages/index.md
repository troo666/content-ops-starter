        subtitle: Open source demo
        text: >+
          We have decided to release a **free, open-source demo** on GitHub,
          allowing you to test one of our key features – **checking whether your
          password has been leaked online**.


          At this stage, the demo operates **without a graphical user interface
          (GUI)**, but our goal is to **familiarize you with this innovative
          technology** and demonstrate its effectiveness in protecting your
          data.


          This is just the beginning – we plan to further develop and integrate
          the full version of the application in the future.

        subtitle: Investing
        text: >+
          We plan to launch **our own cryptocurrency** on **Pump.fun**, followed
          by **Raydium**. You will have the opportunity to purchase it to
          **support our project financially** and potentially achieve
          **significant returns** once our application is released to the
          market.


          This is not only an investment opportunity but also a chance to **be
          part of the development of innovative cybersecurity and data
          protection technology**
